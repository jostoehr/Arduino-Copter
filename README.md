## DIY Arduino Quadcopter
This is a DIY Project to create a selfmade Quadcopter as well as a RC-Controller with an Arduino. 
For both of previously mentioned elements i used an Arduino Uno with a XBee Module for the wireless communication.
To get more details about my approach and the functionality of the Quadcopter, please check out my Wiki to this GitHub Project.
